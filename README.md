# One Sun, Three Tricks

I try to explain the feasibility of a Nimitz-like craft using known physics and Navy patents that bite!

Compile the Nimitz Enigma Paper: By building `one_sun_three_tricks.tex` into a PDF on Linux.

  - Install TeX Live: `sudo apt install texlive-full` (Ubuntu) or `sudo dnf install texlive-scheme-full` (Fedora).

  - Run: `latexmk -pdf one_sun_three_tricks.tex`

PDF’s ready—go crack that Tic-Tac’s secrets.
